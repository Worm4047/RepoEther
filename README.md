## Why is it necessary?  

Did you wonder: 

* Why do scams go unreported?  
* Why do most of the rape cases go unreported?  
* Why are accident cases are not reported effectively? 

and many more wonderings in your head, voices screeching for answers. Now, is the time to REPOETHER 'Em All.    

> Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country [81st](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India) place out of 180 countries. Corruption has adverse impact on the economy as well as the way the authorities work in this country. India has been characterized as one of the ["countries with the lowest per capita rates of rape"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_India). A large number a rape cases go [unreported](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=XsemDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT79&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false). 

There's an urge of having a complaint lodging system, which is open, transparent, efficient, distributed and takes public consensus into consideration, while rewarding them for the proper judgement.
